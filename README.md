This repository contains a COBOL program demonstrating a common error involving data type declarations. The program adds a value to a variable but fails to account for potential negative numbers because the data type declaration for WS-AMOUNT is missing a sign. This results in incorrect calculations. The solution demonstrates how to correctly define the variable to handle both positive and negative values.
